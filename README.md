### This is a simple static vue website, I will attach a DB to it later but for now it will work

# This site is live, and it is in use 😁
# I will attach a DB to it, in wich i will manage the sale of the goods 🎁 

 As for hosting i am using Firebase, it is easy to manage and deploy :octocat:
 To see it live u can navigate to: https://croitorie-ioana-vue.web.app/



# The steps to implement this solution: 

 navigate to the folder "croitorie-ioana"

 open cmd then run

```
npm install
```

 And then host the server locally
```
npm run serve
```
